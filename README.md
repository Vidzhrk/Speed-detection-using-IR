# Speed-detection-using-IR
A speed detection project using two IR sensors and an ESP32. The user enters the distance between the sensors through the Serial Monitor. When an object passes the first sensor, a timer starts and stops at the second sensor. The ESP32 calculates and displays the speed in real time.
